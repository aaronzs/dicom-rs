An ecosystem of library and tools for [DICOM](https://dicomstandard.org) compliant systems.

This collection provides a pure Rust implementation of the DICOM standard,
allowing users to read and write DICOM objects over files and other sources, while
remaining intrinsically fast and safe to use.

## Components

### Library:

- [`core`](core) represents all of the base traits, data structures and functions related to DICOM content.
- [`encoding`](encoding) contains DICOM data encoding and decoding primitives.
- [`parser`](parser) provides a middle-level abstraction for the parsing and printing of DICOM data sets.
- [`object`](object) provides a high-level abstraction of DICOM objects and functions for reading and writing DICOM files.
- [`dictionary-std`](dictionary-std) contains a Rust definition of the standard data dictionary.
- [`transfer-syntax-registry`](transfer-syntax-registry) contains a registry of transfer syntax specifications.
- [`ul`](ul) implements the DICOM upper layer protocol.

### Tools:

- [`dcmdump`](dcmdump) is a command-line application for inspecting DICOM files.
- [`dictionary-builder`](dictionary-builder) is a Rust application that generates code and
  other data structures for a DICOM standard dictionary using entries from the official website.
- [`scpproxy`](scpproxy) implements the Proxy service class provider.
- [`echoscu`](echoscu) implements a Verification service class user.
- [`storescu`](storescu) implements a Storage service class user.
- [`findscu`](findscu) implements a Find service class user.

## Using as a library

[`dicom-object`](object) is currently the most usable crate for reading DICOM objects from a file or a similar source.
As an alternative, the parent crate [`dicom`](parent) can be added instead, which aggregates the key components of the
full library, including `dicom-object`.

An example of use follows. For more details, please visit the [`dicom-object` documentation](https://docs.rs/dicom-object).

```rust
use dicom_object::open_file;
use dicom_object::Result;

let obj = open_file("0001.dcm")?;
let patient_name = obj.element_by_name("PatientName")?.to_str()?;
let modality = obj.element_by_name("Modality")?.to_str()?;
```

## Building

You can use Cargo to build all crates in the repository.

```sh
cargo build --release
```
